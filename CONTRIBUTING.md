ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

## Getting Started
1. Create a fork of the existing repository. This will be your local copy where you can propose new changes.

2. Update the local clone or make changes directly on the forked repo.

## Some stuff you should know
### Formatting
Try to keep your code nice and tidy. Even though it will work it's nice to have it formatted it will make it easier to read.

## Creating a pull request
Yay! ðŸŽ‰ You're making your PR! Here's a template:

```markdown
## Description
Give a short and clear description of the changes you made and why you made them.

## What's been changed
* What you fixed
* What you added
* What you updated 
* What you removed

## Important Notes
* Have you made any  breaking changes (methods removed or renamed, parameters moved or removed)
```

Yayyy, You're all done with the steps! Now just sit back and watch while your Pull request is reviewed and ultimately merged. ðŸŽŠ
